# Algorithm to Rename and Edit Metadata of an Album

1. Copy songs of the album to the directory `input/album/`.
2. Set constants and variables in `utilities.py`.
3. Paste data in `input/album_data.txt`, from Wikipedia table.
4. Check whether the sequence of songs in Wikipedia table matches with the folder.
5. Run `starter.py`.
6. Check console output and ensure that everything is okay. If not, restart from step 1.
7. Download `Folder.gif`.
8. Copy the folder to the directory of archive.
